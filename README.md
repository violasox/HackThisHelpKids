# Smart Pillbox project for Hack This Help Kids Hackathon

This was our project for a 24-hour hackathon aimed at improving pediatric healthcare. We used a raspberry pi and small touchscreen to build a smart medicine dispenser that makes it easy and fun for kids who need to take medications at specific times every day. Up to 5 pills for each of 4 different medications can be loaded, and the device will dispense them at pre-loaded times. The touchscreen and LEDs make it kid-friendly, and Tamagatchi-style games could be added to make taking medicine more fun and less painful.

We were a finalist team and won the Kid's Choice Award!
